# Fibonacci Nth Term

For this program I tried to show a better solution to finding the Nth term of a Fibonacci sequence.

In this program the golden ratio is used in the Equation version, while Recursion is used for the naive version.

To compile:
```
gcc Fibonacci.c -lm -o Fibonacci

```

To run:
```
./Fibonacci

```
